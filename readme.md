# Data Structures

My attempt to implement different data structures, e.g. linked lists, in go.

## Linked Lists

- consists of nodes and a head pointer
- each nodes has data and pointer to next node
- null pointer at last item

### Linked List methods

- output the whole list
- check if an item exists
- delete an item
- append an item

## Queues

- first in first out
- e.g. printer queue

### Queue methods

- push: append item to back of queue
- peek: output first item
- pop (output and remove) first item

## Stacks

- last in first out
- e.g. undo redo

### Stack methods

- push: append item on top
- peek: output item on top
- pop (output and remove) item on top
